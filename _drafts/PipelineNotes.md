it is often beneficial to have a Test script in the root of your module. This is a script set up to load dependencies or really just anything you need to quickly test changes. These might also make it easier to test functions or code when not using an Editor like the ISE. I have found this might be overlooked by some because they go looking at other module's for ideas, but they are forgetting about the files in the `.gitignore`.
